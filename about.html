                <h2>OUR STORY</h2>
                <p>
                    We’re Christopher and Shawn, the founders of DRIVER. What<br> makes us good friends and business partners is our passion for<br> people, creative solutions, sustainability, and electric vehicles.<br> One weekend, during a backpacking trip in the San Bernardino<br> National Forest, we discovered we could make a positive impact<br> on our planet even after we left the forest. Thus, DRIVER was<br> born.
                    Through self-sustainable vehicles, we could prevent carbon<br> emissions from harming the environment. With one rental<br> company, our goal is to inspire the community and the world to<br> opt out of renting gas-powered vehicles and rent sustainable <br>all-electric cars instead.
